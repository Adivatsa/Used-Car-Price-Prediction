# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning Project


The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate **various regression learning methods** on a **kaggle dataset** consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models across cities in the India. Our results show that by using all the **regression model among all the lasso, linear, ridge, xgBoost** found that **xgBosst** has yield the best results. Conventional linear regression also yielded satisfactory results, with the advantage of a significantly lower training time in comparison to the above forementioned machine learning regression methods.
